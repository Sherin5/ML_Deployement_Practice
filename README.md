# ML_Deployement_Practice
This is my first practice using the lecture videos

This readme file includes all the commands and steps that one needs to successfully deploy the project to github and then to Heroku. This is how its done in production in the industry.

Requirements:

1.  [Github Account] (https://github.com/)
2.  [Heroku Account] (https://dashboard.heroku.com/)
3.  VS Code IDE
4.  Git cli

Step 1: Create a folder in your local machine where you want to create the project
Step 2: Create a repository on Github
Step 3: Clone in the repo in your local machine by using
```
git clone <repo link>
```
Step 4: Open the repo in VS code in your local terminal. You should see the readme, gitignore files in the VS code navigator.

Step 5: Create a virual env
```
virtualenv <env_name>

cd <env_name>

source bin/activate
```
